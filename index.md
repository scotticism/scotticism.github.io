## Introduction

Hi, I'm Scott. I'm currently a Substance Abuse Counselor and Social Work Masters Student in Des Moines, Iowa. Before this, I was an Emergency Medical Technician. My interests are in computer science, spirituality, storytelling, psychology, and mental health. 

My purpose in this website is to host a collection of tools that may aid my friends and peers, and otherwise share ideas that may expand how you think and live. 


## 5 Minute Guide on how to be helpful
Observation: Offering unsolicited advice is often counterproductive.  
Evidence: Humans have an instinct to rebut when spoken to at length without the chance to respond.  
Outcome: Lengthy advice triggers people to consciously or unconsciously think of reasons to disagree.  

So what's the alternative?   
It turns out that, more often than not, people **already know** what they need to do to improve their situation. All they need is for someone to listen to and believe in them.

## Excerpt from "Bytes to Behavior", Scott Caso 9-13-24

The rapid advancement of technology in the late 20th century brought significant changes to various fields, including psychology and social work. This section explores two key areas: (1) Computer Diagnostic Assessments, and (2) Social Behavior and Culture.

**Ethical Challenges**  
Computer Assessments have become a powerful tool for their objectivity and accessibility. The assessments can be more capable than a human expert, as in the case of IBM Watson, which can diagnose and plan treatment for a brain cancer patient in just ten minutes-- a task that typically takes a team of experts over 160 hours to complete (Strickland 2017)... But can these computers account for nuances like interpersonal understanding?

"Computers are opaque to sensory information, moods, feelings, and context" Mander (1985). As a result, computer assessments miss subtleties that would be discerned by an expert interviewer. Moreover, an expert will use processes like “intuition checks” to ensure the validity of test results following assessment. Comparatively, computer assessments may be accurate- but not so much valid (Butterfield, 1986, p. 13). In modern times we have noted this in GPT models, which, despite generating detailed responses, often produce content that’s inaccurate or nonsensical (Ziwei et al., 2023).

Another concern is the dehumanizing nature of prioritizing objective data. It is widely acknowledged that “science leaves little room for the spiritual and subjective elements of the world” (Shriver 2003, p. 14). Butterfield warns that “the emotional side of work is subordinated to objective measurements," which reduces human experience to data points (1986, p. 7). This danger of objectivity, combined with the absence of expert judgment, becomes particularly dangerous in self-assessment tools. While self-help books have long been used for self-diagnosis, computer assessments have surged in popularity. These digital tools skip the nuances of reading and understanding to provide instant results. This expedited process brings about significant risks, including misdiagnosis and oversimplification of complex issues, potentially leading to self-stigmatization and harm to one's developing identity.

These risks become even more concerning when we consider expert opinions on computerized therapy. Weizenbaum, creator of Eliza (the first computer psychotherapist), now condemns it as immoral and obscene (Butterfield, 1986, p. 12), warning that “exposure to [even] a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people” (Weizenbaum, 1976). 

**Social behavior and culture.**  

New advances in artificial intelligence have brought about AI friends, AI counselors, and even AI significant others that can be downloaded from the app store. These programs can understand and cater to the user's needs using algorithms that continuously adapt to maximize engagement. Research shows that these technologies are working; internet and smartphone addictions are rapidly increasing worldwide (Méndez et al., 2024). These addictions are associated with excessive use, poor control over use, and significant changes in biopsychosocial health (Méndez et al., 2024). Butterfield, citing Walsh (1985), presciently noted: "These machines [will] hold a person's attention like no other, [as if they have] become addicted to a new drug". 

Indeed, we have observed how this "computer drug" mirrors traditional substance use disorders. Users often present with an intense withdrawal into isolation, dedicating increasing amounts of time and energy to digital activities- phenomena dubbed "bed-rotting" and "doom-scrolling". Smartphone and internet use have been shown to display drug-like characteristics such as tolerance, salience, withdrawal, and craving (Méndez et al., 2024)- hallmarks that predict a substance's addictive potential (Scheel, 2023).

Since individuals can quickly become maladaptive in their use of computers and find themselves in social isolation- it raises concerns about the social development of younger generations. Butterfield, citing Mander (1985), asks: "If children are separated from their parents by hours of TV, from their playmates by video games, and from their teachers by teaching machines, where are they supposed to learn to be human?" This question becomes even more pertinent as smartphone addiction continues to rise, reshaping how we interact and socialize (Méndez et al., 2024).
